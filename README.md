# Benchmarks

* `bench1` populates fixed size queue with empty data
* `bench2` finds maximum value from a series generated by a PRNG

Benchmark results from `bench1` have typically higher standard deviation and are more susceptible to outside noise, due to contention in the Gong algorithm in CAS loop searching for the next free entry.

Note, the default architecture for benchmarks is **not** Intel x86_64, as our knowledge this architecture does not implement `fetch_max` in hardware; instead it is ARMv8.1. The benchmarks were run on AWS Graviton2 EC2 instances (type C6g).
