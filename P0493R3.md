# Introduction

This proposal extends the atomic operations library to add atomic
maximum/minimum operations. These were originally proposed for C++ in [@N3696]
as particular cases of a general "priority update" mechanism, which atomically
combined reading an object's value, computing a new value and conditionally
writing this value if it differs from the old value.

In revision R2 of this paper we have proposed atomic maximum/minimum operations
where it is unspecified whether or not the store takes place if the new value
happens to be the same as the old value. This has caused contention in LEWG, for
example:

> The idea of leaving whether a write occurs or not unspecified has no precedent
> and doesn't play well with memory ordering; it's not possible to have
> `memory_order_release` (or `memory_order_acq_rel`) without a write. (...) I see
> several ways out of this, but think that only one of them makes sense:
> guarantee _read-modify-write_ behavior if the memory order contains release.

The primary purpose of revision R3 is to propose a solution, which is discussed
in section 5.


# Background and motivation

Atomic addition (_fetch-and-add_) was introduced in the NYU Ultracomputer
[@Gottlieb], has been implemented in a variety of hardware architectures, and
has been standardized in C and C++. Atomic maximum/minimum operations
(_fetch-and-max_ , _fetch-and-min_) have a history almost as long as atomic
addition, e.g. see [@Lipovski], and have also been implemented in various
hardware architectures but are not currently standard in C and C++. This
proposal fills the gap.

Atomic maximum/minimum operations are useful in a variety of situations in
multithreaded applications:

- optimal implementation of lock-free shared data structures - as in the
  motivating example later in this paper
- reductions in data-parallel applications: for example,
  [OpenMP](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/#REDUCTION/minimum) supports maximum as a reduction operation
- recording the maximum so far reached in an optimization process, to allow
  unproductive threads to terminate
- collecting statistics, such as the largest item of input encountered by any
  worker thread.

Atomic maximum/minimum operations already exist in several other programming
environments, including
[OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/specs/opencl-2.0-openclc.pdf), and
in some hardware implementations. Application need, and availability, motivate
providing these operations in C++.

The proposed language changes add atomic max/min to `<atomic>`, with some
syntatic adjustment due to the fact that C++ has no infix operators for max/min.


# The problem of conditional write

The existing atomic operations (e.g. `fetch_and`) have the effect of a
_read-modify-write_, irrespective of whether the value changes. This is how atomic
max/min are defined in several APIs (OpenCL, CUDA, C++AMP, HCC) and in several
hardware architectures (ARM, RISC-V). However, some hardware (POWER) implements
atomic max/min as an atomic _read-and-conditional-store_.

If we look at an example CAS-loop implementation of this proposal, it is easy to
see why such _read-and-conditional-store_ can be more efficient.

## Example CAS-loop implementation with _read-modify-write_

In this version we are performing an unconditional store, which means all
writers need exclusive cache line access. This may result in excessive writer
contention.

```cpp
template <typename T>
T atomic_fetch_max_explicit(atomic<T>* pv,
                            typename atomic<T>::value_type v,
                            memory_order m) noexcept {
    auto t = pv->load(memory_order_relaxed);
    while (!pv->compare_exchange_weak(t, max(v, t), m, memory_order_relaxed))
      ;
    return t;
}
```

## Example CAS-loop implementation with _read-and-conditional-store_

Note the condition of the `while` loop below. It skips skip write entirely if
`pv` is already equal to `max(v, t)`. This significantly reduces writer
contention.

```cpp
template <typename T>
T atomic_fetch_max_explicit(atomic<T>* pv,
                            typename atomic<T>::value_type v,
                            memory_order m) noexcept {
    auto t = pv->load(m);
    while (max(v, t) != t) {
        if (pv->compare_exchange_weak(t, v, m, memory_order_relaxed))
            break;
    }
    return t;
}
```

Always requiring a store renders this algorithm non-conforming. Similarly
non-conforming would be a hardware instruction with the
_read-and-conditional-store_ semantics. This is a problem.

Ideally, we would like to:

- implement atomic min/max on hardware which performs this operation with the
  _read-and-conditional-store_ semantics, without falling back to CAS algorithm
- use more efficient implementation without writes, when memory order requested
  by the user does not contain release

We think this might be possible, as demonstrated below.


## Example CAS-loop implementation with _read-modify-write_ (synthetic)

The idea is to allow for a "synthetic" write at the same point where the
preceding algorithm performed `load()`.

```cpp
template <typename T>
T atomic_fetch_max_explicit(atomic<T>* pv,
                            typename atomic<T>::value_type v,
                            memory_order m) noexcept {
    auto t = ((m == memory_order_relaxed || m == memory_order_acquire || m == memory_order_consume)
              ? pv->load(m)
              : pv->fetch_add(0, m));
    while (max(v, t) != t) {
        if (pv->compare_exchange_weak(t, v, m, memory_order_relaxed))
            break;
    }
    return t;
}
```

The `fetch_add` operation added above ensures that the memory order `m` is
applied at the program point expected by the user. On architectures which
implement atomic min/max in hardware with _read-and-conditional-store_
semantics, this memory barrier could be applied with an extra instruction
(possibly equivalent to `fetch_add(0)` above) hence allowing conforming
implementation which does not have to perform a CAS loop. Such an implementation
might also perform a conditional check on type of memory barrier requested
(similar to demonstrated above), hence granting user access to a more efficient
operation without store, if no release was requested by the user. The question
arises, would such implementation be conforming to the existing definition of
_read-modify-write_ ?


## The wording problem

Questions for wording experts:

- does the proposed semantics in section 5.3 meet the existing definition of
  _read-modify-write_ as applied to other atomic operations?
- if not, how do we word the semantics presented in 5.3?


# Motivating example

Atomic fetch-and-max can be used to implement a lockfree bounded multi-consumer,
multi-producer queue. Below is an example based on [@Gong]. Note, the original
paper assumed existence of `EXCHANGE` operation which in practice does not exist
on many platforms. Here this was replaced by a two-step read and write, in
addition to translation from C to C++. For this reason the correctness proof from
[@Gong] does not apply.

```cpp
template <typename T, size_t Size>
struct queue_t {
  using elt = T;
  static constexpr int size = Size;

  struct entry {
    elt item {};                            // a queue element
    std::atomic<int> tag {-1};              // its generation number
  };

  entry elts[size] = {};                    // a bounded array
  std::atomic<int> back {-1};

  friend void enqueue(queue_t& queue, elt x) noexcept {
    int i = queue.back.load() + 1;          // get a slot in the array for the new element
    while (true) {
      // exchange the new element with slots value if that slot has not been used
      int empty = -1;                       // expected tag for an empty slot
      auto& e = queue.elts[i % size];
      // use two-step write: first store an odd value while we are writing the new element
      if (std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&e.tag, &empty, (i / size) * 2 + 1)) {
        using std::swap;
        swap(x, e.item);
        e.tag.store((i / size) * 2);        // done writing, switch tag to even (ie. ready)
        break;
      }
      ++i;
    }
    std::atomic_fetch_max(&queue.back, i);  // reset the value of back
  }

  friend auto dequeue(queue_t& queue) noexcept -> elt {
    while (true) {                          // keep trying until an element is found
      int range = queue.back.load();        // search up to back slots
      for (int i = 0; i <= range; i++) {
        int ready = (i / size) * 2;         // expected even tag for ready slot
        auto& e = queue.elts[i % size];
        // use two-step read: first store -2 while we are reading the element
        if (std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&e.tag, &ready, -2)) {
          using std::swap;
          elt ret{};
          swap(ret, e.item);
          e.tag.store(-1);                  // done reading, switch tag to -1 (ie. empty)
          return ret;
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

# Summary of proposed additions to `<atomic>`

The current `<atomic>` provides atomic operations in several ways:

- as a named non-member function template e.g. `atomic_fetch_add` returning the
  old value
- as a named member function template e.g. `atomic<T>::fetch_add()` returning
  the old value
- as an overloaded compound operator e.g. `atomic<T>::operator+=()` returning
  the new value

Adding 'max' and 'min' versions of the named functions is straightforward.
Unlike the existing atomics, max/min operations exist in signed and unsigned
flavors. The atomic type determines the operation. There is precedent for this
in C, where all compound assignments on atomic variables are defined to be
atomic, including sign-sensitive operations such as divide and right-shift.

The overloaded operator `atomic<T>::operator `_key_`=(n)` is defined to return
the new value of the atomic object. This does not correspond directly to a named
function. For max and min, we have no infix operators to overload. So if we want
a function that returns the new value we would need to provide it as a named
function. However, for all operators the new value can be obtained as
`fetch_`_key_`(n) `_key_` n`, (the standard defines the compound operator
overloads this way) while the reverse is not true for non-invertible operators
like 'and' or 'max'. Thus the functions would add no significant functionality
other than providing one-to-one equivalents to `<atomic>` existing compound
operator overloads. Following some of the early literature on atomic operations
([@Kruskal] citing [@Draughon]), we suggest that these names should have the
form `replace_`_key_, as shown in the wording section.

The authors are happy to remove these `replace_` functions from the paper, if
such feedback is received. They are provided in this version of the paper for
the sake of interface completness.

# Changes to the C++ standard

**Proposed changes are missing floating point support, which will to be added before publication**

**As discussed above, the write semantics of proposed atomic min/max may require additional wording**

The following text outlines the proposed changes, based on [@N4868].

**31: Atomic operations library [atomics]**

**31.2: Header <atomic> synopsis [atomics.syn]**

_Add:_

```cpp
namespace std {
  // 31.9, non-member functions
  ...
  template<class T>
    T atomic_fetch_max(volatile atomic<T>*, typename atomic<T>::value_type) noexcept;
  template<class T>
    T atomic_fetch_max(atomic<T>*, typename atomic<T>::value_type) noexcept;
  template<class T>
    T atomic_fetch_max_explicit(volatile atomic<T>*, typename atomic<T>::value_type, memory_order) noexcept;
  template<class T>
    T atomic_fetch_max_explicit(atomic<T>*, typename atomic<T>::value_type, memory_order) noexcept;
  template<class T>
    T atomic_fetch_min(volatile atomic<T>*, typename atomic<T>::value_type) noexcept;
  template<class T>
    T atomic_fetch_min(atomic<T>*, typename atomic<T>::value_type) noexcept;
  template<class T>
    T atomic_fetch_min_explicit(volatile atomic<T>*, typename atomic<T>::value_type, memory_order) noexcept;
  template<class T>
    T atomic_fetch_min_explicit(atomic<T>*, typename atomic<T>::value_type, memory_order) noexcept;
  ...
}
```

**31.7.3: Specializations for integral types [atomics.ref.int]**

_Add:_

```cpp
namespace std {
  template <> struct atomic_ref<integral> {
    ...
    integral fetch_max(integral, memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst) const noexcept;
    integral fetch_min(integral, memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst) const noexcept;
    ...
    integral replace_max(integral) const noexcept;
    integral replace_min(integral) const noexcept;
  };
}
```

_Change:_

  Remarks: For signed integer types, the result is as if the object value and
  parameters were converted to their corresponding unsigned types, the
  computation performed on those types, and the result converted back to the
  signed type.

_to:_

  Remarks: Except for `fetch_max` and `fetch_min`, for signed integer types, the
  result is as if the object value and parameters were converted to their
  corresponding unsigned types, the computation performed on those types, and
  the result converted back to the signed type. For `fetch_max` and `fetch_min`,
  the computation is performed according to the integral type of the atomic
  object.
