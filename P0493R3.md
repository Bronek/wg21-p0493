# Introduction

This proposal extends the atomic operations library to add atomic
maximum/minimum operations. These were originally proposed for C++ in [@N3696]
as particular cases of a general "priority update" mechanism, which atomically
combined reading an object's value, computing a new value and conditionally
writing this value if it differs from the old value.

In revision R2 of this paper we have proposed atomic maximum/minimum operations
where it is unspecified whether or not the store takes place if the new value
happens to be the same as the old value. This has caused contention in LEWG, but
upon further discussion in SG1, turned out to be not needed - as discussed in
section 5.


# Background and motivation

Atomic addition (_fetch-and-add_) was introduced in the NYU Ultracomputer
[@Gottlieb], has been implemented in a variety of hardware architectures, and
has been standardized in C and C++. Atomic maximum/minimum operations
(_fetch-and-max_ , _fetch-and-min_) have a history almost as long as atomic
addition, e.g. see [@Lipovski], and have also been implemented in various
hardware architectures but are not currently standard in C and C++. This
proposal fills the gap.

Atomic maximum/minimum operations are useful in a variety of situations in
multithreaded applications:

- optimal implementation of lock-free shared data structures - as in the
  motivating example later in this paper
- reductions in data-parallel applications: for example,
  [OpenMP](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/#REDUCTION/minimum) supports maximum as a reduction operation
- recording the maximum so far reached in an optimization process, to allow
  unproductive threads to terminate
- collecting statistics, such as the largest item of input encountered by any
  worker thread.

Atomic maximum/minimum operations already exist in several other programming
environments, including
[OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/specs/opencl-2.0-openclc.pdf), and
in some hardware implementations. Application need, and availability, motivate
providing these operations in C++.

The proposed language changes add atomic max/min to `<atomic>` for builtin
types, including integral, pointer and floating point.


# The problem of conditional write

The existing atomic operations (e.g. `fetch_and`) have the effect of a
_read-modify-write_, irrespective of whether the value changes. This is how atomic
max/min are defined in several APIs (OpenCL, CUDA, C++AMP, HCC) and in several
hardware architectures (ARM, RISC-V). However, some hardware (POWER) implements
atomic max/min as an atomic _read-and-conditional-store_.

If we look at an example CAS-loop implementation of this proposal, it is easy to
see why such _read-and-conditional-store_ can be more efficient.

## Example CAS-loop implementation with _read-modify-write_

In this version we are performing an unconditional store, which means all
writers need exclusive cache line access. This may result in excessive writer
contention.

```cpp
template <typename T>
T atomic_fetch_max_explicit(atomic<T>* pv,
                            typename atomic<T>::value_type v,
                            memory_order m) noexcept {
    auto t = pv->load(memory_order_relaxed);
    while (!pv->compare_exchange_weak(t, max(v, t), m, memory_order_relaxed))
      ;
    return t;
}
```

## Example CAS-loop implementation with _read-and-conditional-store_

Note the condition of the `while` loop below. It skips skip write entirely if
`pv` is already equal to `max(v, t)`. This significantly reduces writer
contention.

```cpp
template <typename T>
T atomic_fetch_max_explicit(atomic<T>* pv,
                            typename atomic<T>::value_type v,
                            memory_order m) noexcept {
    auto t = pv->load(m);
    while (max(v, t) != t) {
        if (pv->compare_exchange_weak(t, v, m, memory_order_relaxed))
            break;
    }
    return t;
}
```

If we require _read-modify-write_, this *could* be a non-conforming
implementation. However if we add a dummy write such as `pv->fetch_add(0, m)` in
any point of the above algorithm (presumably only if `m` contains release) then
it would be conforming again, since it is unobservable where *exactly* such a
store happened. Indeed, on some architectures, it is also unobservable whether
or not a store took place, _if the value does not change_ as a result of store.

Similarly, given an architecture which implements this instruction in hardware,
but with _read-and-conditional-store_ semantics, a conforming
_read-modify-write_ `fetch_max()` can be implemented on top of such an
instruction, e.g. with an addition of a dummy store.

For this reason **and** for consistency with all other atomic instructions, we
have decided to use _read-modify-write_ semantics for the new atomic
minimum/maximum.


# Infix operators in `<atomic>` and min/max

The current `<atomic>` provides atomic operations in several ways:

- as a named non-member function template e.g. `atomic_fetch_add` returning the
  old value
- as a named member function template e.g. `atomic<T>::fetch_add()` returning
  the old value
- as an overloaded compound operator e.g. `atomic<T>::operator+=()` returning
  the **new** value

Adding 'max' and 'min' versions of the named functions is straightforward.
Unlike the existing atomics, max/min operations exist in signed and unsigned
flavors. The atomic type determines the operation. There is precedent for this
in C, where all compound assignments on atomic variables are defined to be
atomic, including sign-sensitive operations such as divide and right-shift.

The overloaded operator `atomic<T>::operator` _key_ `=(n)` is defined to return
the new value of the atomic object. This does not correspond directly to a named
function. For `max` and `min`, we have no infix operators to overload. So if we
want a function that returns the new value we would need to provide it as a
named function. However, for all operators the new value can be obtained as
`fetch_`_key_`(n) ` _key_ ` n`, (the standard defines the compound operator
overloads this way) while the reverse is not true for non-invertible operators
like 'and' or 'max'.

Thus new functions returning the new result would add no significant
functionality other than providing one-to-one equivalents to `<atomic>` existing
compound operator overloads. Revision R2 of this paper tentatively suggested
such functions, named `replace_`_key_ (following some of the early literature on
atomic operations - [@Kruskal] citing [@Draughon]). Having discussed this in
SG1, the authors have decided _not_ to propose addition of extra functions and
correspondingly they have been _removed_ in revision R3. This same result can be
obtained by the user with a simple expression such as `max(v.fetch_max(x), x)`
or `min(v.fetch_min(x), x)`.

During discussion in SG1, it was suggested that a new paper could be written
proposing _key_`_fetch` functions returning new values. This is not such paper.


# Motivating example

Atomic fetch-and-max can be used to implement a lockfree bounded multi-consumer,
multi-producer queue. Below is an example based on [@Gong]. Note, the original
paper assumed existence of `EXCHANGE` operation which in practice does not exist
on many platforms. Here this was replaced by a two-step read and write, in
addition to translation from C to C++. For this reason the correctness proof from
[@Gong] does not apply.

```cpp
template <typename T, size_t Size>
struct queue_t {
  static_assert(std::is_nothrow_default_constructible_v<T>);
  static_assert(std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<T>);
  static_assert(std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<T>);

  using elt = T;
  static constexpr int size = Size;

  struct entry {
    elt item {};                            // a queue element
    std::atomic<int> tag {-1};              // its generation number
  };

  entry elts[size] = {};                    // a bounded array
  std::atomic<int> back {-1};

  friend void enqueue(queue_t& queue, elt x) noexcept {
    int i = queue.back.load() + 1;          // get a slot in the array for the new element
    while (true) {
      // exchange the new element with slots value if that slot has not been used
      int empty = -1;                       // expected tag for an empty slot
      auto& e = queue.elts[i % size];
      // use two-step write: first store an odd value while we are writing the new element
      if (std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&e.tag, &empty, (i / size) * 2 + 1)) {
        using std::swap;
        swap(x, e.item);
        e.tag.store((i / size) * 2);        // done writing, switch tag to even (ie. ready)
        break;
      }
      ++i;
    }
    std::atomic_fetch_max(&queue.back, i);  // reset the value of back
  }

  friend auto dequeue(queue_t& queue) noexcept -> elt {
    while (true) {                          // keep trying until an element is found
      int range = queue.back.load();        // search up to back slots
      for (int i = 0; i <= range; i++) {
        int ready = (i / size) * 2;         // expected even tag for ready slot
        auto& e = queue.elts[i % size];
        // use two-step read: first store -2 while we are reading the element
        if (std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&e.tag, &ready, -2)) {
          using std::swap;
          elt ret{};
          swap(ret, e.item);
          e.tag.store(-1);                  // done reading, switch tag to -1 (ie. empty)
          return ret;
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
