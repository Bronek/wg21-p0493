# Introduction

This proposal extends the atomic operations library to add atomic
maximum/minimum operations. These were originally proposed for C++ in [@N3696]
as particular cases of a general "priority update" mechanism, which atomically
combined reading an object's value, computing a new value and conditionally
writing this value if it differs from the old value.

In revision R2 of this paper we have proposed atomic maximum/minimum operations
where it is unspecified whether or not the store takes place if the new value
happens to be the same as the old value. This has caused contention in LEWG, but
upon further discussion in SG1 turned out to be unnecessary - as discussed in
section 5.


# Background and motivation

Atomic addition (_fetch-and-add_) was introduced in the NYU Ultracomputer
[@Gottlieb], has been implemented in a variety of hardware architectures, and
has been standardized in C and C++. Atomic maximum/minimum operations
(_fetch-and-max_ , _fetch-and-min_) have a history almost as long as atomic
addition, e.g. see [@Lipovski], and have also been implemented in various
hardware architectures but are not currently standard in C and C++. This
proposal fills the gap in C++.

Atomic maximum/minimum operations are useful in a variety of situations in
multithreaded applications:

- optimal implementation of lock-free shared data structures - as in the
  motivating example later in this paper
- reductions in data-parallel applications: for example,
  [OpenMP](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/#REDUCTION/minimum) supports maximum as a reduction operation
- recording the maximum so far reached in an optimization process, to allow
  unproductive threads to terminate
- collecting statistics, such as the largest item of input encountered by any
  worker thread.

Atomic maximum/minimum operations already exist in several other programming
environments, including
[OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/specs/opencl-2.0-openclc.pdf), and
in some hardware implementations. Application need, and availability, motivate
providing these operations in C++.

The proposed language changes add atomic max/min to `<atomic>` for builtin
types, including integral, pointer and floating point.


# The problem of conditional write

The existing atomic operations (e.g. `fetch_and`) have the effect of a
_read-modify-write_, irrespective of whether the value changes. This is how
atomic max/min are defined in several APIs (OpenCL, CUDA, C++AMP, HCC) and in
several hardware architectures (ARM, RISC-V). However, some hardware (POWER)
implements atomic max/min as an atomic _read-and-conditional-store_. If we look
at an example CAS-loop implementation of this proposal, it is easy to see why
such _read-and-conditional-store_ can be more efficient.

Following the discussion in SG1 the authors are convinced that a similar
implementation can be conforming, _with some adjustments_ (example presented in 5.3),
without the catch all wording such as "_it is unspecified whether or not the store takes place_".

### Note {-}

Example polyfill implementations listed below rely on a simple helper function whose
task is to adjust `memory_order` to make it a valid operand for the load operations:

```cpp
constexpr inline memory_order drop_release(memory_order m) noexcept {
  return (m == memory_order_release ? memory_order_relaxed
      : ((m == memory_order_acq_rel || m == memory_order_seq_cst) ? memory_order_acquire
          : m));
}
```

## Example CAS-loop implementation with _read-and-conditional-store_

This implementation skips writes entirely if `pv` is already equal to `max(v, t)`. It
**does not** conform with the _read-modify-write_ semantics, which this paper proposes:

```cpp
template <typename T>
T atomic_fetch_max_explicit(atomic<T>* pv,
                            typename atomic<T>::value_type v,
                            memory_order m) noexcept {
    auto const mr = drop_release(m);
    auto t = pv->load(mr);
    while (max(v, t) != t) {
        if (pv->compare_exchange_weak(t, v, m, mr))
            break;
    }
    return t;
}
```

## Example CAS-loop implementation with _read-modify-write_

This implementation is performing an unconditional store, which means all writers
need exclusive cache line access. Although conforming with the _read-modify-write_
semantics, this may result in excessive writer contention:

```cpp
template <typename T>
T atomic_fetch_max_explicit(atomic<T>* pv,
                            typename atomic<T>::value_type v,
                            memory_order m) noexcept {
    auto const mr = drop_release(m);
    auto t = pv->load(mr);
    while (!pv->compare_exchange_weak(t, max(v, t), m, mr))
      ;
    return t;
}
```

## Example improved CAS-loop implementation with _read-modify-write_

This implementation is based on _read-and-conditional-store_, with an added extra step to ensure
that a store does take place at least once, _if required_:

- if the user requested memory order is _not_ a release, then store is not
  required
- otherwise, add a dummy write such as `fetch_add(0, m)` and use its result.

This is demonstrated below:

```cpp
template <typename T>
T atomic_fetch_max_explicit(atomic<T>* pv,
                            typename atomic<T>::value_type v,
                            memory_order m) noexcept {
    auto const mr = drop_release(m);
    auto t = (mr != m) ? pv->fetch_add(0, m) : pv->load(mr);
    while (max(v, t) != t) {
        if (pv->compare_exchange_weak(t, v, m, mr))
            return t;
    }

    return t;
}
```

A subtle difference between this and the previous implementation is that,
in this case, an extra "dummy" store can take place. The authors argue that
this difference in behaviour is unobservable in the standard C++ memory model.

Similarly, given an architecture which implements atomic minimum/maximum in
hardware with _read-and-conditional-store_ semantics, a conforming
_read-modify-write_ `fetch_max()` can be implemented with very little overhead.

For this reason **and** for consistency with all other atomic instructions, we
have decided to use _read-modify-write_ semantics for the proposed atomic
minimum/maximum.


# Infix operators in `<atomic>` and min/max

The current `<atomic>` provides atomic operations in several ways:

- as a named non-member function template e.g. `atomic_fetch_add` returning the
  old value
- as a named member function template e.g. `atomic<T>::fetch_add()` returning
  the old value
- as an overloaded compound operator e.g. `atomic<T>::operator+=()` returning
  the **new** value

Adding 'max' and 'min' versions of the named functions is straightforward.
Unlike the existing atomics, max/min operations exist in signed and unsigned
flavors. The atomic type determines the operation. There is precedent for this
in C, where all compound assignments on atomic variables are defined to be
atomic, including sign-sensitive operations such as divide and right-shift.

The overloaded operator `atomic<T>::operator` _key_ `=(n)` is defined to return
the new value of the atomic object. This does not correspond directly to a named
function. For `max` and `min`, we have no infix operators to overload. So if we
want a function that returns the new value we would need to provide it as a
named function. However, for all operators the new value can be obtained as
`fetch_`_key_`(n) ` _key_ ` n`, (the standard defines the compound operator
overloads this way) while the reverse is not true for non-invertible operators
like 'and' or 'max'.

Thus new functions returning the new result would add no significant
functionality other than providing one-to-one equivalents to `<atomic>` existing
compound operator overloads. Revision R2 of this paper tentatively suggested
such functions, named `replace_`_key_ (following some of the early literature on
atomic operations - [@Kruskal] citing [@Draughon]). Having discussed this in
SG1, the authors have decided _not_ to propose addition of extra functions and
correspondingly they have been _removed_ in revision R3. This same result can be
obtained by the user with a simple expression such as `max(v.fetch_max(x), x)`
or `min(v.fetch_min(x), x)`.

During the discussion in SG1, it was suggested that a new paper could be written
proposing _key_`_fetch` functions returning **new** values. This is _not_ such
paper.


# Motivating example

Atomic fetch-and-max can be used to implement a lockfree bounded multi-consumer,
multi-producer queue. Below is an example based on [@Gong]. Note, the original
paper assumed existence of `EXCHANGE` operation which in practice does not exist
on most platforms. Here this was replaced by a two-step read and write, in
addition to translation from C to C++. For this reason the correctness proof from
[@Gong] does not apply.

```cpp
template <typename T, size_t Size>
struct queue_t {
  static_assert(std::is_nothrow_default_constructible_v<T>);
  static_assert(std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<T>);
  static_assert(std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<T>);

  using elt = T;
  static constexpr int size = Size;

  struct entry {
    elt item {};                            // a queue element
    std::atomic<int> tag {-1};              // its generation number
  };

  entry elts[size] = {};                    // a bounded array
  std::atomic<int> back {-1};

  friend void enqueue(queue_t& queue, elt x) noexcept {
    int i = queue.back.load() + 1;          // get a slot in the array for the new element
    while (true) {
      // exchange the new element with slots value if that slot has not been used
      int empty = -1;                       // expected tag for an empty slot
      auto& e = queue.elts[i % size];
      // use two-step write: first store an odd value while we are writing the new element
      if (std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&e.tag, &empty, (i / size) * 2 + 1)) {
        using std::swap;
        swap(x, e.item);
        e.tag.store((i / size) * 2);        // done writing, switch tag to even (ie. ready)
        break;
      }
      ++i;
    }
    std::atomic_fetch_max(&queue.back, i);  // reset the value of back
  }

  friend auto dequeue(queue_t& queue) noexcept -> elt {
    while (true) {                          // keep trying until an element is found
      int range = queue.back.load();        // search up to back slots
      for (int i = 0; i <= range; i++) {
        int ready = (i / size) * 2;         // expected even tag for ready slot
        auto& e = queue.elts[i % size];
        // use two-step read: first store -2 while we are reading the element
        if (std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&e.tag, &ready, -2)) {
          using std::swap;
          elt ret{};
          swap(ret, e.item);
          e.tag.store(-1);                  // done reading, switch tag to -1 (ie. empty)
          return ret;
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```


# Implementation experience

The required intrinsics have been added to Clang.

# Benchmarks

We have implemented benchmark `bench` and made it available on [@Github].

* `bench` is finding a maximum value from a PRNG. We were able to achieve
  acceptably low standard deviation of results for this test. The selected PRNG
  is a linear distribution 2e9 wide, using 10'000 PRNG samples per run. In this
  benchmark, the `fetch_max` updates were relatively infrequent.

We have measured the nanosecond time of different implementations of:

```
atomic_fetch_max_explicit(&max, i, std::memory_order_acq_rel)
```

where `i` is generated by a PRNG. The benchmarks capture the cost of contention to `max`
from varying number of cores. The benchmarks were run on AWS EC2 instance type
`c7g.16xlarge` (i.e. 64 cores ARMv8.4 Graviton3 CPU). The machine was running Linux
kernel 6.1 and was configured for complete isolation of cores 1-63.
We used core 0 only when running the benchmark across all 64 cores, in
which case the samples from this core were dropped (to avoid the noise caused by
the normal operating system operation).

The benchmark parameters were:

* `-m 0.5` : maximum std. deviation for PRNG cost calibration
* `-i 1e6` : number of iterations (this translates to 100 runs, each sampling the PRNG
  10'000 times)

The table below compares two `fetch_max` implementations:

* `-t t` : CAS-loop based algorithm presented in 5.3 (we call it "smart")
* `-t h` : hardware instruction `ldsmaxl` available in ARM8.1 instruction set

During benchmarking, we have observed that the time of _read-and-conditional-store_
CAS-loop algorithm (as presented in 5.2, we call it "weak" in the benchmarks) was
almost immeasurable, _irrespective_ of the number of cores. We explain this by how
rarely the PRNG sampling benchmark updates the `max` value. Similarly the "smart"
algorithm with `std::memory_order_release` had shown to be very fast, _irrespective_
of the number of cores.

# Note on pointer operations

It was pointed out that the semantics of pointer operations is not clear in the
revision 3 of this paper. The new wording in revision 4 makes it clear that the new
atomic operations perform computation as-if by `max` and `min` algorithms, which
also work on pointers if these point the same complete object (or array), see
[expr.rel] remark 4. The intent is to give `fetch_max` and `fetch_min` the same
semantics, including the requirements.

This is in apparent divergence from other atomic operations which are guaranteed
not to create undefined behaviour (e.g. _"If the result is not a representable value
for its type (7.1), the result is unspecified, but the operations otherwise have
no undefined behavior."_ for floating point and _"The result may be an undefined
address, but the operations otherwise have no undefined behavior."_ for pointers).
Note that `fetch_max` and `fetch_min` _in principle_ do not create new values as
opposed to other atomic functions; the result of the function is either an old
value of the atomic object or a new value, as provided by the caller. Hence there's
less demand for an "escape clause" for potentially "undefined address" (there
_likely_ isn't one).

If this proposal is accepted and we gain more experience with existing
implementations of `fetch_max` and `fetch_min`, plausibly an "escape clause"
similar to ones quoted above _might_ be added in the future revisions of C++ e.g.
by allowing comparison of unrelated pointers. At this moment we aren't certain
that such hypothetical clause would be implementable; furthermore a user with a
need for such operation could use conversion to and from `uintptr_t` instead
(and deal with the fallout of using resulting pointer).


# Note on floating point operations

Following the discussion in Varna '23 plenary, also carried on the reflector,
the authors decided to remove the proposed `fetch_min` and `fetch_max` from the
loating point specializations (that is, sections `[atomics.types.float]` and
`[atomics.ref.float]`).

Floating point types do not receive the same treatment in `std::min` and `std::max`
as other types do (due to the presence of NaN values and signed zero), hence they would
have to be either defined using different means, or at the very least worded differently.
Since there already is implementation experience regarding the use of `std::fmin` and
`std::fmax` in atomic operations on floating point numbers, and a new paper [@P3008]
is being prepared to propose the relevant addition in the standard, trying
to nail down the semantics based on `std::min` and `std::max` in this proposal seems
counterproductive.

  the result converted back to the signed type.

  [_Note 2 : There are no undefined results arising from the computation. —- end note_]

- _Add remark 9 immediately below:_

  [ [9]{.pnum} _Remarks_: For `fetch_max` and `fetch_min`, the maximum and minimum
  computation is performed as if by `max` and `min` algorithms [alg.min.max], respectively,
  with the object value and the first parameter as the arguments.]{.add}

- _Bump existing remarks below new remark 9_


**33.5.8.5 Partial specialization for pointers [atomics.types.pointer]**

- _Add following public functions, immediately below `fetch_sub`:_

```txt
namespace std {
  template <class T> struct atomic<T*> {
    ...
    T* fetch_max(T*, memory_order = memory_order::seq_cst) volatile noexcept;
    T* fetch_max(T*, memory_order = memory_order::seq_cst) noexcept;
    T* fetch_min(T*, memory_order = memory_order::seq_cst) volatile noexcept;
    T* fetch_min(T*, memory_order = memory_order::seq_cst) noexcept;
    ...
  };
}
```

- _In table 147, [tab:atomic.types.pointer.comp], add the following entries (note empty "Op" column):_

  | **key** |    **Op**   | **Computation** |
  |:-------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
  | `max`   |   | maximum |
  | `min`   |   | minimum |


- _Add remark 9 with note 2 immediately below remark 8:_

  [ [9]{.pnum} _Remarks_: For `fetch_max` and `fetch_min`, the maximum and minimum
  computation is performed as if by `max` and `min` algorithms [alg.min.max], respectively,
  with the object value and the first parameter as the arguments.]{.add}

  [ [_Note 2: If the pointers point to different complete objects (or subobjects thereof),
  the < operator does not_ 
  _establish a strict weak ordering ([tab:cpp17.lessthancomparable],[expr.rel]) -- end note_] ]{.add}

- _Bump existing remarks below new remark 9_
