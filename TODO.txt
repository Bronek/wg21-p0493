FIX FORMATTING OF OLD PAPER



# Abstract

Add integer *max* and *min* operations to the set of operations supported in `<atomic>`. There are minor adjustments to function naming necessitated by the fact that `max` and `min` do not exist as infix operators.

# Open isues

In contrast to the existing atomic operations, some platforms which are known to implement atomic *min* and *max* in hardware, leave it unspecified as to whether the write takes place if the new value is the same as the old value. This paper acknowledges such platforms and proposes a solution to enable writing portable code using the newly proposed atomic operations.
